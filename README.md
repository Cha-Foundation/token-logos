# Token logos

## Overview
Oolongswap token logos repository is a comprehensive, up-to-date collection of information of various crypto tokens.
Such a large collection can be maintained only through a community effort, so _feel free to add your token_.

## How to add token

Please note that __brand new tokens are not accepted__,
the projects have to be sound, with information available, and __non-minimal circulation__

**Adding an ERC20 token checklist**:
- [ ] Fork the Github repository
- [ ] Create folder with name of token smartcontact address in _checksum format_ `/<chainId>/<token_smartcontract_address>/`. (e.g `/288/0x5008F837883EA9a07271a1b5eB0658404F5a9610`)
- [ ] Tell your designer that token image must be in PNG format, preferably transparent background, recommended size 256x256px, with max file size of 100kB.
- [ ] Upload your logo with file named `logo.png` to previously created folder with smartcontract address, and if you done all correctly your path should look like this. `/288/0x5008F837883EA9a07271a1b5eB0658404F5a9610/logo.png`
- [ ] Create a pull request to the main branch of the this repo
